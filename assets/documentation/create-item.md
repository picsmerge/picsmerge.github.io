## Are the edges of the image sharp?

Do not worry. This is just a preview.
The original of the image is saved correctly and you can choose whether to smooth the edges when downloading.

## Order of Layers

The lower numbered layers will be drawn first and the higher numbered layers will be drawn later.

## Lack of Layers

You may want to upload images less than configured number of layers. That's okay.
Insufficient layers will be treated as blank images when merged.
However, if you want to make the first layer to empty and second layer to visible,
you need to upload blank image for the first layer.
