You may be seeing this image for the second time.

This image can consist of **Hair**, **Face**, and **Background** Groups,
and the **Hair** Group can be divided into front hair and back hair layers.

Suppose you have uploaded front hair to the first layer of the **Hair** Group and back hair to the second layer.
And you want to reduce the number of layers of **Hair** Group to **1** on the Edit Group page.

In that case, the back hair of all Items in the Hair Group will be removed once you save your changes.
